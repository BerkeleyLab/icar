!! Main Program
!!
!! Initialize options and memory in init_model
!! Read initial conditions in bc_init (from a restart file if requested)
!! initialize physics packages in init_physics (e.g. tiedke and thompson if used)
!! If this run is a restart run, then set start to the restart timestep
!!      in otherwords, ntimesteps is the number of BC updates from the beginning of the entire model
!!      run, not just from the begining of this restart run
!! calculate model time in seconds based on the time between BC updates (in_dt)
!! Calculate the next model output time from current model time + output time delta (out_dt)
!!
!! Finally, loop until ntimesteps are reached updating boundary conditions and stepping the model forward
